This file contains a list of all of the string tags that are used by the Messenger, and a brief description
of what they are for:

....Samplee useage:  Say you wanted to include the entity with the broadcast...

Messenger.Broadcast("String tag", thingToInclude, otherThingToInclude, thirdThingToInclude);  <---- up to 3.

....or none at all!!

Messenger.Broadcast("Heartbeat");

....easy as pie. Listening for the broadcast and doing something is almost as easy:
....if we were listening for that first broadcast that included three datatypes, we'd need two things:
....	a message to the Messenger telling the name of the function to run, and what message we're listening for.
....	a function to run when the message is received
....    for this example, thingToInclude is a Entity, otherThingToInclude is another entity, and 
....		thirdThingToInclude is a number. (damage from one entity to another, maybe?)

Messenger.AddListener("String tag", MyFunctionToRun);

private void MyFunctionToRun(Entity firstThing, Entity otherThing, float thirdThing){
		//Do stuff with the datatypes that were broadcast!

}







"GameObjectMoved" - includes the entity that moved... Is broadcasts every time an object moves

"OnUpdate" - no object included - broadcasts every update frame, and should be used by components
			that need to perform an action in the Unity Update() method.

"EntityCreated" - Broadcast whenever the EntityInitializer finishes constructing an entity - listened for by
				the entity manager, who adds the entity to the master list.

"EntityDestroyed" - Not Implemented yet

"ObstructionAdded" - Broadcast whenever an obstructable component switches from being disabled to enabled

"ObstructionRemoved" - Broadcast whenever an obstructable component switches from being enabled to disabled

"GameObjectSelected" - includes the GameObject that was selected - broadcast whenever a left mouse click is placed
						over a unit character in the TestController scene - needs to be refactored to be generic.

"GameObjectDeselected" - reverse of above, includes the GameObject that was deselected.

"GroundClicked" - Broadcast by TestControllerScene when a left mouse click doesn't hit something on layer 8
